  abstract = {This chapter presents reasoning for taking an alternative research approach to the study of processes that unfold within individuals over time as part of their daily lives. To this end I focus on three issues. First, I present a brief historical account that shows the large-sample approach is not necessarily the only appropriate research approach in psychology. Second, I discuss the limitations of this approach, specifically, if our interest is in studying psychological processes that take place within individuals. Finally, I discuss several alternatives to the standard large-sample approach that allow us to take a closer and more detailed look at the processes as they are occurring in daily life.

  abstract = {The direction of an association at the population-level may be reversed within the subgroups comprising that population\textemdash a striking observation called Simpson's paradox. When facing this pattern, psychologists often view it as anomalous. Here, we argue that Simpson's paradox is more common than conventionally thought, and typically results in incorrect interpretations \textendash{} potentially with harmful consequences. We support this claim by drawing on empirical results from cognitive neuroscience, behavior genetics, psychopathology, personality psychology, educational psychology, intelligence research, and simulation studies. We show that Simpson's Paradox is most likely to occur when inferences are drawn across different levels of explanation (e.g., from populations to subgroups, or subgroups to individuals). We propose a set of statistical markers indicative of the paradox, and offer psychometric solutions for dealing with the paradox when encountered\textemdash including a toolbox in R for detecting Simpson's Paradox. We show that explicit modeling of situations in which the paradox might occur not only prevents incorrect interpretations of data, but also results in a deeper understanding of what data tell us about the world.},

  abstract = {The theoretical content of Suicide has been thoroughly discussed, but relatively little attention has been paid to the ways in which Durkheim tested and refined his theories with empirical data. Durkheim's empirical analyses are multivariate: each additional variable is systematically incorporated into the relationships that have perviously been studied. The analyses are also replicative: the same relationship is studied in widely varying contexts. A careful study of the consequences of these procedures, both intended and unintended, yields valuable insights into current problems of theoretically oriented empirical research.},
