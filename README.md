# The ecologocal fallacy: Thorndike's (1939) example

The ecological fallacy occurs when results from group-level analyses are wrongly extended to individuals. The fallacy is often attributed to William S. Robinson's (1950) paper [*Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2087176?origin=crossref&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) and the name itself first appeared in sociologist Hanan C. Selvin's (1958) paper, [*Durkheim's suicide and problems of empirical research*](https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/33024288/Durkheim-suicide_empirical-research-problems.pdf?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DDurkheims_Suicide_and_Problems_of_Empiri.pdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A%2F20191014%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20191014T151247Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=4e9eeb342fa0332cd0f7ed00a4769661cb7c6921e07dd19a763595f037d35dae). However, my fellow psychologists might be happy to learn the idea goes back at least as far as E. L. Thorndike's (1939) paper, [*On the fallacy of imputing the correlations found for groups to the individuals or smaller groups composing them*](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1416673?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). The purpose of this project is to walk out Thorndikes original examples.
